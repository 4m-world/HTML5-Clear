What is this?
===

The awesome Clear app (almost) replicated in HTML5.

This is tested on iOS only. And don't play too fast - you'll break it!

The original iphone app by Realmac: [http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/)

What's the point?
===

Mainly because I wanted to experiment with touch events and CSS3 transitions.

I love the design of the original app, so I decided to redo it in HTML5. It's not 100% copied, some of the features are kinda hard to be perfectly ported, but it's pretty damn close.

Why didn't you use frameworks like A/B/C?

I just wanted to play with the look and feel, so I just did it fast and dirty. The code is quite messy and far from robust. Refactoring in the future might be some good practice.
