What is this?

The awesome Clear app (almost) replicated in HTML5.

The original iphone app by Realmac: [http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/)

What's the point?
===

Mainly because I wanted to practice dealing with touch events and CSS3 transitions by making something.

As I love the design of the original app, I decided to redo it in HTML5. It's not 100% copied, there are quite a few details missing, but it's pretty damn close.

Why didn't you use frameworks like A/B/C?

Again, mainly because I wanted to practice... I wanted to get the look and feel fast and dirty, so I just did it without much planning ahead. The code is quite messy, and refactoring in the future might be good practice too.
